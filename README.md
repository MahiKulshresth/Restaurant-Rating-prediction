# Restaurant-Rating-prediction
This repository contains code for a restaurant rating prediction system built using machine learning techniques such as linear regression and decision tree regression. The system predicts the ratings of restaurants based on various features such as location, price range, cuisine, and more.
-Overview

**The prediction system utilizes two main algorithms:**

Linear Regression: This algorithm fits a linear model to the dataset, allowing predictions to be made based on the linear relationship between features and restaurant ratings.

Decision Tree Regression: Decision trees are used to model the relationships between features and ratings by partitioning the feature space into smaller regions.

**Evaluation**
The performance of the prediction system is evaluated using the R-squared (RÂ²) metric. R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the ratings that is predictable from the features. A higher R-squared value indicates better predictive performance.
